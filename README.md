## The `genogram` package

This is a small for-fun project which lead to a small LaTeX package.
It is probably not about the most useful package, since it is about drawing simple genograms, but it might still be inspiring for somebody, somewhere at some point. :sweat_smile:

If you are interested in knwoing more about it, have a glance to [the manual](genogram_manual.pdf).
The main point behind this work was to build an as easy as possible interface between the `pgf/TikZ` world and LaTeX newbies, so that they can easily draw without needing to know any new syntax.
