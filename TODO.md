# To-do list

- [ ] Change the way to draw couple status. In particular, do not use a `tikzstyle` but an extra node to be added in the `tikzpicture` explicitly. This will facilitate annotations with the date of wedding, separation, divorce.
- [ ] Consider to connect children to parents in case they are moved too much out with the outper space keys.
